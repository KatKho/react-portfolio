Originally from Moscow, Russia, I've been calling the United States home for the past 6 years.\n\nMy journey has been a diverse one, taking me through various roles and experiences. From exploring photography and working in pharmacy tech to immersing myself in marine biology and serving in the Coast Guard as a yeoman, I've embraced each opportunity with enthusiasm.\n\nThe ever-evolving world of web development has captured my interest, and I'm committed to staying at the forefront of this dynamic field. With a deep love for gaming and a fascination with the rapid advancements in AI, I'm driven to make a meaningful impact in both realms.\n\nCurrently, I'm pursuing a software development course at Code Fellows, where I'm blending academic knowledge with hands-on experience. I'm on the lookout for exciting projects that allow me to channel my creativity and drive positive change.\n\nLet's connect and explore how we can collaborate to shape a brighter future! ðŸš€",
